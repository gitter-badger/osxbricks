## What's OSXBricks ?

> One day, you probably found a solution to a problem you search for several months or get an ingenious idea and you said to you **"I'm sure somebody wants this information !"**. That's what I do on **OSXBricks**. This is the best way I found to **share my experience, my discoveries** in informatics and particularly around the Apple Developer world. 
>
> **OSXBricks** take its name with two of my passion OS X for Mac OS X (or no *just* OS X) and **Bricks** for the Lego's bricks. For me informatics look like Lego game : you need to associate bricks (function, method, libraries, frameworks...) to create your own program (or a pirate ship ðŸ˜Š)
